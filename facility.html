<h2>First-principles Calculation</h2>

<p>Ultra-wide-band-gap (UWBG) semiconductors have tremendous potential for RF and high-power electronics as the wider band gap allows for higher breakdown voltage that enables high-power and fast switching with lower energy loss. However, a wider band gap generally leads to doping inefficiency and carrier localization, which inhibits semiconductor applications. The focus of our research is to discover new UWBG semiconductors that are unexplored but have superior material properties to surpass the state of the art. To do this, we use first principles defect calculation based on hybrid density functional theory to uncover novel UWBG semiconductors with efficient doping properties. We then experimentally realize prospective materials by growing single-crystalline thin films using epitaxial growth techniques and characterizing the structural and electronic properties of films. We also explore various dopants and the interplay between charged defects to enhance doping efficiency while pushing to the limit to semiconductor band gap.</p>
